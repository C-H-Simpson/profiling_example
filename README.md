# Profiling - why is my python slow?
Sometimes, you find the code you write takes unacceptably long to run, and you don't know why.
*Profiling* means testing what parts of your code are using the most resources.
In this example, I show you how to use [rkern's line profiler](https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler), which is a library for profiling python scripts.
